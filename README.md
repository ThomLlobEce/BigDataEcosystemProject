# Get this project running on your machine

## Create a python virtual environement

If you haven't installed virtualenv yet :
```
pip install virtualenv
```

Create and activate a virtual environnement (replace myenv by the name of your choice)

```
python -m venv myenv
myenv\Scripts\activate
```

## Install dependencies

### Python packages

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Sparks

* Windows 

To get sparks on windows, you can follow this tutorial (You can skip Step 1 & 2 if you already have both java and python running on your machine) :
https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-spark-on-windows-10

* Mac OS

To get sparks on mac OS, you can follow this tutorial :
https://medium.com/beeranddiapers/installing-apache-spark-on-mac-os-ce416007d79f

* Linux

To get sparks on ubuntu, you can follow this tutorial :
https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-spark-on-ubuntu

### ElasticSearch

You can get elastic search running on your computer by following the next tutorial :

https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/getting-started-install.html#run-elasticsearch-local


### Kibana

You can get kibana running on your computer by following the next tutorial :

* Mac OS X :
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/targz.html#install-darwin64

* Linux :
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/targz.html#install-linux64

* Windows :
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/windows.html#install-windows


# Run the project

Once you have gathered all the dependencies, follow the next steps (depending on your OS):

* Windows : 
1. Start Elasticsearch 

```
.\elasticsearch.bat
```
Elasticsearch should be accessible from https://localhost:9200

2. Start Kibana 

```
.\bin\kibana.bat
```
Kibana should be accessible from https://localhost:5601

3. Run the project 

```
python scheduler.py
```
4. You can run the project in test mode (simulate the last 10 days in ~ 20 minutes instead of 10 days)
```
python scheduler.py --test
```

* Linux / Mac OS :
1. Start Elasticsearch 

```
./elasticsearch
```
Elasticsearch should be accessible from https://localhost:9200

2. Start Kibana

```
./bin/kibana
```
Kibana should be accessible from https://localhost:5601

3. Run the project 

```
python scheduler.py

```
4. You can run the project in test mode (simulate the last 10 days in ~ 20 minutes instead of 10 days)
```

python scheduler.py --test
```

This will automatically, each day :
* Fetch data from https://ourworldindata.org/
* Pre process the previous day data using sparks
* Create and calculate new columns using sparks such as the death rate, percentage of vaccination or the proportion of infected people in the population 
* Save the pre process data into a {date}.json file
* Push the new data to elasticsearch and update all visualisations

# On Kibana

Now that you have the project running you will have to import the dashboard on Kibana.

* In Kibana in the left drawer menu go to **Stack Management** (should be at the very end) 
* Under **Kibana** go to **Saved Objects**
* Now you can import on the top right the file **dashboard.ndjson**
* Once you imported it you should see in the table Saved Objects **Covid_dashboard_ECE**, click on it.
* Make sure that the filter date on the top right of the dashboard is set to December 20 -> now

Enjoy !

You should get this result :
